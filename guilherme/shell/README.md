# Shell Scripting

- Make a basic script using RegEx
  - Some used RegEx:
    - `^` initial value
    - `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` some value that will be needed
    - `+` will sum one regex each other to make a bigger one
    - `\` will escape special characters
    - `{min, max}` will determine min and max number of characters
    - `$` will determine end of the word

## How run:

- in `shell` directory run `./basic-script.sh`
- :warning: if you don't have permission run the following command: `sudo chmod ./basic-script.sh`
